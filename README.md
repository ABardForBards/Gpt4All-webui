This is a Flask web application that provides a chat UI for interacting with the GPT4All chatbot.

## What is GPT4All

GPT4All is a language model built by Nomic-AI, a company specializing in natural language processing. The app uses Nomic-AI's library to communicate with the GPT4All model, which runs locally on the user's PC. For more details about this project, head on to their [github repository](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all). You can also reald their [Technical report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.nomic.ai/gpt4all/2023_GPT4All_Technical_Report.pdf) for more information about the training process, the batabase etc.

The app allows users to send messages to the chatbot and view its responses in real-time. Additionally, users can export the entire chat history in text or JSON format.

The model has just been released and it may evolve over time, this webui is meant for community to get easy and fully local access to a chatbot that may become better with time.

## Disclaimer

The model used by GPT4ALL has been fine-tuned using the LORA technique on LLAMA 7B weights (for now). It is important to note that the LLAMA weights are under commercial proprietary license, and therefore, this model cannot be used for commercial purposes. We do not provide the weights ourselves, but have built a UI wrapper on top of the Nomic library, which downloads the weights automatically upon running the program.

It is important to understand that we are not responsible for any misuse of this tool. Please use it responsibly and at your own risk. While we hope that Nomic will address this issue in the future by providing clean weights that can be used freely, for now, this model is intended for testing purposes only.

**Note for Windows users:** At the moment, Nomic-AI has not provided a wheel for Windows, so you will need to use the app with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To install WSL, follow these steps:

Open the Windows Features settings (you can find this by searching for "Windows Features" in the Start menu).

Enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" feature.

Restart your computer when prompted.

Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store (e.g., Ubuntu).

Open the Linux distribution and follow the prompts to create a new user account.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. W

## Usage

To run the Flask server, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py [--port PORT] [--host HOST] [--temp TEMP] [--n-predict N_PREDICT] [--top-k TOP_K] [--top-p TOP_P] [--repeat-penalty REPEAT_PENALTY] [--repeat-last-n REPEAT_LAST_N] [--ctx-size CTX_SIZE]
```

*   `--host`: the host address on which to run the server (default: localhost)
*   `--temp`: the sampling temperature for the model (default: 0.1)
*   `--n-predict`: the number of tokens to predict at a time (default: 128)
*   `--top-k`: the number of top-k candidates to consider for sampling (default: 40)
*   `--top-p`: the cumulative probability threshold for top-p sampling (default: 0.90)

## Future Plans

Here are some of the future plans for this project:

**Enhanced control of chatbot parameters:** We plan to improve the user interface (UI) of the chatbot to allow users to control the parameters of the chatbot such as temperature and other variables. This will give users more control over the chatbot's responses, and allow for a more customized experience.

**Extension system for plugins:** We are also working on an extension system that will allow developers to create plugins for the chatbot. These plugins will be able to add new features and capabilities to the chatbot, and allow for greater customization of the chatbot's behavior.

**Enhanced UI with themes and skins:** Additionally, we plan to enhance the user interface of the chatbot to allow for themes and skins. This will allow users to personalize the appearance of the chatbot, and make it more visually appealing.

We are excited about these future plans for the project and look forward to implementing them in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!
